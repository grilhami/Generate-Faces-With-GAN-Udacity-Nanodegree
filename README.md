# Generate-Faces-With-GAN-Udacity-Nanodegree

The goal of this project is to generate faces of famous celebrities using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In short, a GAN consist of two Deep Neural Networks facing off agaisnt each other. One neural networks tries to replicate real data (in this case images) from noise data, and the other tries to detect which are fake or real.
